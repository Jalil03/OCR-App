This is an ocr project with python to convert invoices (bank) to digital format 

-> This is mvc logic , so in the Controller folder you will find 3 files , main the one that contains the ocr api , the "detecting_lines.py" that detects lines and tables in pdfs , and regex_patterns that contain some patterns 

-> So to sum it up , main.py to lunch the ocr api (converting invoices to digital formats) , and the Detecting_lines.py to show another api of detecting lines from tables 


NOTE : 

    the Detecting_lines api is not finished yet , and it can make mistakes . Plus , this project now has a frontend with just some basic html , css and js , in the next update it will be with angular js . And to not forget this api is build with FastAPI .
